  My relationship with PHP
---

I have my last year in Valmieras Tehnikums so it's important that I get my practical skills down in a real world environment. School realizes this through various internships that happen every year and I am very pleased that I got my internship at [CUBE agency][cube].

Their main programming language for web development is PHP. For modern technology approach Laravel + Vue is go to option for them to build websites with. Previously I have used Django as a back-end technology for some projects and I am glad that Laravel follows the same MVC pattern. It's just syntax that I have to get comfortable with hehe! 

A convient discovery for me was that it's possible to insert mock data into data base with seeders and factories. 

Compared maybe to C# Laravel feels more easier to use. A lot of things are optimised for easier use. Another vivid example would be pagination use in Laravel. It's really that simple.

```php
$pagination = Model::class->paginate(3);
```

For front-end Vue is their weapon of choice. As I have only worked with React I am glad that they share the same principles between themselves. Both are made for reactivity and reusability. But one thing that feels weird to me is that Vue seperates templating from logic. 

I can get the idea why the framework was created that way, but I suppose that I am used to React's way of displaying data. 

A wonderful opportunity to try and have a look from a diffrent view.

But before I say goodbye I wanted to thank Jeffrey Way (creator of [Laracasts][laracasts]) for the brilliant approach to interactive tutorials and engaging programming content. This guys just gets how to teach people.

Thanks for reading and see you in the next blog !!
